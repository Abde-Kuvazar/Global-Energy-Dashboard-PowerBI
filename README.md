üåç Global Energy Consumption & Renewable Trends Dashboard

An interactive Business Intelligence dashboard developed in Power BI to analyze historical global energy consumption patterns, track the growth of renewable energy sources, and identify key shifts in the world's energy mix.

üí° Project Overview

This project provides data-driven insights into the evolving landscape of global energy, focusing on:
* Overall energy consumption trends by source (Fossil Fuels, Renewables, Nuclear, etc.).
* The accelerating adoption and impact of renewable energy technologies (Solar, Wind, Hydro).
* Identifying key moments and shifts in the global energy supply.

**Goal:** To transform raw energy data into actionable intelligence, empowering stakeholders (like those at Schlumberger!) to understand macro energy trends and their implications for strategic planning and decision-making.



üìä Key Features & Visualizations

The dashboard is designed for intuitive exploration and insight discovery. Here are some of the key components:

1. **Global Energy Mix Evolution (Stacked Area Chart)**
* Shows the changing composition of global primary energy consumption over time, highlighting the increasing share of renewables.

2. **Renewable Energy Growth Trends (Line Chart)**
* Dedicated view illustrating the rapid individual growth trajectories of Solar, Wind, and other renewable energy sources.

3. **Key Global Energy Performance Indicators (KPI Cards)**
* Prominent display of critical metrics such as:
    * Total Global Energy Consumption (Latest Year)
    * % Renewable Energy Share (Latest Year)
    * % Fossil Fuel Share (Latest Year)


4. **Annual Energy Mix Breakdown (Donut Chart with Slicer)**
* An interactive donut chart allowing users to select any year and instantly see the proportional breakdown of energy sources for that specific period.


5. **Total Consumption vs. Key Source Trends (Line Chart)**
* Compares the overall global energy consumption against the growth of specific categories (e.g., Total Renewables or Total Fossil Fuels) to provide comparative insights.

üîç Key Insights & Findings

* **Exponential Renewable Growth:** Solar and wind energy have shown remarkable growth rates, significantly contributing to the diversification of the global energy mix, especially in the last two decades.
* **Persistent Fossil Fuel Reliance:** Despite the surge in renewables, fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas) continue to constitute the largest share of global energy consumption, highlighting the scale of the energy transition challenge.
* **Shifting Renewable Composition:** While hydropower has historically been a major renewable source, solar and wind are rapidly increasing their proportional contribution to the renewable energy portfolio.
